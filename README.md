# Plotly_Deployment
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this module challenge is to build a completed panel for demographic information with bactial data visualization for each volunteer. The current webpage projected the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer's belly button so that identification of the species can be found in their system to see whether Improbable Beef can be synthesized.
